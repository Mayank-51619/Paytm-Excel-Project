Overview
---------
Implemented a stock price forecasting model using regression analysis to predict future share prices based on historical stock data. The project involved analyzing financial market trends, developing a regression model, and evaluating its predictive accuracy.

Project Details:
-----------------

Data Collection:
------------------
Extracted historical stock data from financial markets, including Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Adjusted Close, and Volume.
Regression Model Development:

Utilized a regression model (y = a + bx) for stock price forecasting.
Calculated coefficients Alpha (a) and Beta (b) to determine the relationship between independent and dependent variables.
Forecasting and Evaluation:

Forecasted future share prices for specific dates using the developed model.
Evaluated the model's performance using key metrics:
Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD): 439.79
Mean Squared Error (MSE): 193,413.21
Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE): 57.6%

Outcome:
----------
Successfully predicted stock prices for future dates, providing insights into potential market trends.
Key Achievements:

Achieved a MAPE of 57.6%, indicating a reasonable level of accuracy in the forecasting model.
Implemented regression analysis with Alpha (a) as 54,588.98 and Beta (b) as -1.2049.
Technologies Used:

Excel for data manipulation and analysis.

Challenges and Learning:
-------------------------

Overcame challenges in data preprocessing and model fine-tuning.
Gained valuable experience in applying regression analysis to real-world financial data.

Next Steps:
-------------
Explore advanced forecasting techniques.
Incorporate additional features for improved model accuracy.
